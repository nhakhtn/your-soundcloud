= Features =

* Browse through your soundcloud tracks, sets and favorites from a tab in the media upload window (see screenshot), no need to go back and forth between soundcloud and your website.
* Save multiple users, very useful for labels, collectives or artists with many projects
* Live Preview in the Tab, see what does what instantly (see screenshot).
* Integrates perfectly with wordpress media upload by using the same listing style that you get with the images (see screenshot).
* See track's info directly in the tab (description, url, cover, etc...).
* Set default settings from the option page (see screenshot):
    * Default player type (Mini, Standard, Artwork, Html5)
    * Width
    * Extra Classes for the div that wraps around the player
    * Auto Play
    * Show/Hide Comments
    * Player's Colors
* Use shortcode
* Plugin construct shortode for you, no need to remember any syntax.
* Style sortcode for neat layout in your editor.
* Implement Soundcloud Html5 player (beta).
* Widget for showing latest and random track, favorites or sets for one user, multiple users or random users.
* Follow WP developpers guidelines (enqueue scripts and styles just for the plugin, clean code, commented, secure and leave no trace when uninstall ).

= Advantages against pasting embed code from soundcloud =

* By changing the main settings in the options, all players on your site using the default settings will change. If green isn't trendy anymore and black is the new white, it won't be a problem and you keep your street credibility safe.
* If Soundcloud update their player or release a even cooler new player that let you scratch your track while streaming to google+, I will most defenetly update the plugin to use those new features.

That's just my opinion of course...


= To Do List =

* v3: So much to do I can't list it.
* V3: Advance Settings (change background color and comments color, playcounts, buy link, font, wmode, etc, show/hide styled shortcode, number of tracks per page)
* v3: url attribute for shortcode: easier for people using the shortcode manually.
* v3: other soundcloud shortcode conflict fix (jetpack)
* Add Soundcloud default Width to the options
* Trigger live preview when changing Soundcloud user name
* Live search while typing a name in the user name field. So if you're looking for someone it's kind of easier.
* Add 'activities' to a widget
* Fall Back for smartphone to html5 player when using flash player.
